Hi All,

I have created a simple quiz game.
Here you answer 5 questions and at the end of it you can submit your answers.

This is my first application using jQuery.
I have used progress bar and pagination for better flow and to learn about jQuery in depth.

The application is hosted at - https://chirag0406.github.io/quizgame/

I hope ypu like it and can always suggest some improvement and new ideas are always welcomed. :)

Cheers !!
Happy Coding !!
